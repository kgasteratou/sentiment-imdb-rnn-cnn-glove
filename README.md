# Sentiment Analysis – RNN (BiLSTM) vs TextCNN with GloVe

This repository contains compact, public-safe code artifacts for a sentiment analysis project
inspired by IMDB-style movie review classification.

## What is included
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, padding)
- Model definitions:
  - **BiLSTM** (RNN-based)
  - **TextCNN**
- **GloVe embeddings** support (frozen vs trainable)
- Minimal inference demo (no dataset files)

## What is NOT included (for safety/licensing)
- The original IMDB dataset is not uploaded.
- No trained checkpoints are uploaded.
- No private keys or credentials are used.

## How to run (Jupyter/Python)
- See `notebooks/rnn_cnn_inference_demo.md` for a minimal inference demo.
- Core code lives in `src/`.

## Notes
This repository is intended as a portfolio artifact demonstrating NLP model architecture and workflow.
